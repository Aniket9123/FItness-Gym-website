                <li><u><b>Pushups :</b></u>  </li>
                <p> A conditioning exercise performed in a prone position by raising and lowering the body with the straightening and bending of the arms while keeping the back straight and supporting the body on the hands and toes.</p>
                <li><u><b> Weight Lifting :</b>
                </u></li>
                <p>.
                   Exercise by lifting heavy objects (such as barbells) in order to become stronger.<br>
                   The benefits of lifting weights include building muscle, burning body fat, strengthening your bones and joints, reducing injury risk, and improving heart health. To lift weights safely, it's important to start slow, take rest days, and always use proper form.</p> 
                   

                                Lie on an incline bench holding a dumbbell in each hand above your face, with your palms facing and a slight bend in your elbows. Lower them to the sides, then bring them back to the top.</p>
                                <li><u> <b>Triceps extension :</b></u></li>
                                <p>The triceps extension is an isolation exercise that works the muscle on the back of the upper arm. This muscle, called the triceps, has three heads: the long head, the lateral head, and the medial head. The three heads work together to extend the forearm at the elbow joint.
                                    </p>
                                    <li><u><b> Pull-up :</b></u></li>
                                    <p>A pullup is an upper body strength training exercise. To perform a pullup, you start by hanging onto a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your body extended fully.</p>
                           
                                <li><u><b> Standing biceps curl :</b></u></li>
                                <p>A biceps curl usually starts with the arm in a fully extended position, holding a weight with a supinated (palms facing up) grip. A full repetition consists of bending or "curling" the elbow until it is fully flexed, then slowly lowering the weight to the starting position.</p>
